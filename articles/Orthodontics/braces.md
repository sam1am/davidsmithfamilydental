# Braces in Salt Lake City, UT

At our dental practice in Salt Lake City, UT, we offer a range of orthodontic treatments, including traditional braces, to help our patients achieve straight, healthy smiles. Braces are a common and effective way to correct a variety of orthodontic issues, such as:

1. Crowded or crooked teeth
2. Gaps between teeth
3. Overbite or underbite
4. Crossbite or open bite
5. Misaligned jaw

Braces work by applying gentle, continuous pressure to your teeth to gradually move them into the desired position. They consist of metal brackets that are bonded to your teeth and connected by a thin wire. The wire is periodically tightened to maintain the proper amount of pressure on your teeth.

The length of treatment with braces varies depending on the severity of your orthodontic issues, but typically ranges from 12 to 24 months. During this time, you will need to visit our office regularly for adjustments and progress checks.

In addition to traditional metal braces, we also offer clear ceramic braces and Invisalign clear aligners for patients who desire a more discreet orthodontic treatment option. We will work with you to determine which type of braces is best suited to your individual needs and preferences.

While wearing braces, it is important to maintain good oral hygiene to prevent tooth decay and gum disease. We will provide you with instructions for brushing and flossing around your braces, as well as recommendations for avoiding certain foods that can damage your braces or prolong your treatment time.

After your braces are removed, you will need to wear a retainer to help maintain your newly straightened smile. We will provide you with a custom-made retainer and instructions for wearing and caring for it.

If you are interested in improving the alignment of your teeth and the overall health and appearance of your smile, contact our office today to schedule a consultation. We will be happy to answer any questions you may have and help you determine if braces are right for you.
