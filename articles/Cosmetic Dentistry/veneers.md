# Porcelain Veneers in Salt Lake City, UT

At our dental practice in Salt Lake City, UT, we offer porcelain veneers as a cosmetic solution for improving the appearance of your smile. Veneers are thin, custom-made shells of tooth-colored porcelain that are designed to cover the front surface of your teeth. They can be used to correct a wide range of aesthetic concerns, including:

1. Discolored or stained teeth
2. Chipped or broken teeth
3. Misshapen or uneven teeth
4. Gaps between teeth
5. Worn or short teeth

Porcelain veneers offer several advantages over other cosmetic dental treatments, including:

1. Natural appearance: Porcelain veneers are designed to match the color, shape, and translucency of your natural teeth, providing a seamless and natural-looking result.
2. Durability: With proper care and maintenance, porcelain veneers can last for many years.
3. Stain-resistance: Porcelain veneers are resistant to staining and discoloration, helping to maintain the brightness of your smile over time.
4. Minimally invasive: Veneers require minimal tooth preparation, making them a conservative alternative to dental crowns.

The process of getting porcelain veneers typically involves two visits to our office. During the first visit, we will:

1. Evaluate your oral health and discuss your cosmetic goals to determine if veneers are right for you.
2. Prepare your teeth by removing a small amount of enamel to accommodate the thickness of the veneers.
3. Take impressions of your teeth to create custom-made veneers.
4. Place temporary veneers to protect your teeth while the permanent veneers are being made.

During the second visit, we will:

1. Remove the temporary veneers and check the fit, shape, and color of the permanent veneers.
2. Make any necessary adjustments to ensure a comfortable and natural-looking fit.
3. Permanently bond the veneers to your teeth using a special dental cement and light beam.

After the procedure, you may experience some sensitivity to hot and cold temperatures, but this should subside within a few days. We will provide you with instructions for caring for your new veneers and maintaining good oral hygiene to ensure their longevity.
