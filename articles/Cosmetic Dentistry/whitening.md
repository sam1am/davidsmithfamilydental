# Teeth Whitening in Salt Lake City, UT

At our dental practice in Salt Lake City, UT, we offer professional teeth whitening services to help our patients achieve brighter, more radiant smiles. Teeth can become stained or discolored over time due to a variety of factors, including aging, certain foods and drinks, smoking, and certain medications. Our teeth whitening treatments are designed to safely and effectively remove these stains and restore the natural whiteness of your teeth.

We offer two types of teeth whitening treatments:

1. In-office whitening: This treatment is performed in our office and involves the application of a high-concentration whitening gel to your teeth. The gel is activated by a special light or laser, and the entire process takes about an hour. In-office whitening can provide dramatic results in a single visit.
2. At-home whitening: This treatment involves the use of custom-made whitening trays and a lower-concentration whitening gel that you can apply at home. You will need to wear the trays for a specified amount of time each day, typically for two to four weeks. At-home whitening provides more gradual results, but can be a convenient and cost-effective option for many patients.

Before recommending a teeth whitening treatment, we will evaluate your oral health and discuss your cosmetic goals to determine which option is right for you. We will also provide you with instructions for maintaining your newly whitened smile, such as avoiding certain foods and drinks and practicing good oral hygiene.

Teeth whitening is a safe and effective way to enhance the appearance of your smile, and can provide a significant boost to your self-confidence.

We look forward to helping you achieve the bright, beautiful smile you deserve!
