# Dental Cleanings in Salt Lake City, UT

Regular dental cleanings are an essential part of maintaining good oral health. At our dental practice in Salt Lake City, UT, we offer thorough, gentle cleanings to help keep your teeth and gums healthy and strong.

During a typical cleaning appointment, one of our skilled dental hygienists will:

1. Remove plaque and tartar buildup from your teeth using special tools
2. Floss between your teeth to remove any remaining debris
3. Polish your teeth to remove surface stains and leave your smile looking bright and shiny
4. Apply a fluoride treatment to help strengthen your enamel and prevent cavities

We recommend that most patients visit us for a cleaning and exam every six months. However, some patients may need more frequent cleanings if they have certain risk factors, such as a history of gum disease or a weakened immune system.

In addition to professional cleanings, it's important to practice good oral hygiene habits at home. This includes brushing your teeth twice a day with a fluoride toothpaste, flossing daily, and using an antiseptic mouthwash to kill harmful bacteria.

If it's been a while since your last dental cleaning, don't worry - it's never too late to get back on track! Contact our office today to schedule an appointment and take the first step towards a healthier, cleaner smile.
