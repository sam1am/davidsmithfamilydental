# Dental Fillings in Salt Lake City, UT

At our dental practice in Salt Lake City, UT, we offer a range of dental filling options to help our patients restore damaged or decayed teeth and maintain optimal oral health. Dental fillings are a common and effective treatment for cavities, and can also be used to repair cracked or broken teeth.

We offer several types of dental fillings, including:

1. Amalgam fillings: These are the traditional "silver" fillings that have been used for many years. They are made of a mixture of metals, including silver, tin, and copper, and are known for their durability and strength.
2. Composite fillings: These are tooth-colored fillings made of a mixture of plastic and glass. They are designed to match the color of your natural teeth and are a popular choice for filling cavities in visible areas of the mouth.
3. Glass ionomer fillings: These fillings are made of a mixture of glass and acrylic, and are often used for fillings below the gum line or in areas where there is minimal biting pressure.
4. Ceramic fillings: These fillings are made of porcelain and are designed to match the color of your natural teeth. They are highly durable and resistant to staining, making them a popular choice for larger fillings or inlays/onlays.

The process of getting a dental filling typically involves one visit to our office. During the visit, we will:

1. Numb the area around the affected tooth to ensure your comfort during the procedure.
2. Remove any decayed or damaged tooth material using special tools.
3. Clean and prepare the tooth for the filling.
4. Place the filling material and shape it to fit the contours of the tooth.
5. Harden the filling material using a special light.
6. Polish the filling to ensure a smooth and comfortable fit.

After the procedure, you may experience some sensitivity or discomfort in the treated tooth, but this should subside within a few days. We will provide you with instructions for caring for your new filling and maintaining good oral hygiene to prevent future cavities.

If you have a cavity or damaged tooth, don't wait to seek treatment. Contact our office today to schedule an appointment and learn more about our dental filling options. We look forward to helping you achieve and maintain optimal oral health!
