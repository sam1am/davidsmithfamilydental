# Dental Crowns in Salt Lake City, UT

At our dental practice in Salt Lake City, UT, we offer custom-made dental crowns to help our patients restore damaged or decayed teeth and improve the function and appearance of their smiles. A dental crown is a tooth-shaped "cap" that is placed over a damaged or weakened tooth to protect and strengthen it.

We may recommend a dental crown for a variety of reasons, including:

1. To protect a tooth that has been weakened by decay or injury
2. To restore a tooth that has been badly damaged or worn down
3. To support a tooth that has had a large filling or root canal treatment
4. To improve the appearance of a misshapen or discolored tooth
5. To secure a dental bridge or top a dental implant

We offer several types of dental crowns, including:

1. Porcelain crowns: These crowns are made of high-quality ceramic material and are designed to match the color and translucency of your natural teeth. They are a popular choice for front teeth or any visible areas of the mouth.
2. Porcelain-fused-to-metal crowns: These crowns have a metal base that is covered with a layer of porcelain. They offer the strength and durability of metal with the natural appearance of porcelain.
3. Gold crowns: These crowns are made of a mixture of gold and other metals, and are known for their durability and strength. They are often used for back teeth that are subject to heavy biting forces.

The process of getting a dental crown typically involves two visits to our office. During the first visit, we will:

1. Numb the area around the affected tooth to ensure your comfort during the procedure.
2. Prepare the tooth by removing any decayed or damaged material and shaping it to accommodate the crown.
3. Take impressions of the prepared tooth and surrounding teeth to create a custom-made crown.
4. Place a temporary crown over the prepared tooth to protect it while the permanent crown is being made.

During the second visit, we will:

1. Remove the temporary crown and check the fit and appearance of the permanent crown.
2. Make any necessary adjustments to ensure a comfortable and secure fit.
3. Permanently cement the crown in place.

With proper care and maintenance, a dental crown can last for many years. We will provide you with instructions for caring for your new crown and maintaining good oral hygiene to ensure its longevity.

If you have a damaged or decayed tooth that may benefit from a dental crown, contact our office today to schedule a consultation. We look forward to helping you restore your smile and improve your oral health!
