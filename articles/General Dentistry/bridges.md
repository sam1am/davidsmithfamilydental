# Dental Bridges in Salt Lake City, UT

If you're missing one or more teeth, a dental bridge may be an excellent solution for restoring your smile and improving your oral health. At our dental practice in Salt Lake City, UT, we offer custom-made bridges to help our patients achieve optimal function and aesthetics.

A dental bridge is a prosthetic device that is used to replace one or more missing teeth. It consists of one or more artificial teeth, called pontics, which are anchored in place by dental crowns on either side of the gap. The crowns are attached to the natural teeth adjacent to the missing tooth or teeth, providing a stable and secure foundation for the bridge.

There are several types of dental bridges, including:

1. Traditional bridges: These are the most common type of bridge, and consist of one or more pontics held in place by dental crowns on either side of the gap.
2. Cantilever bridges: These bridges are used when there are natural teeth on only one side of the gap. The pontic is anchored in place by a dental crown on one side only.
3. Maryland bridges: These bridges consist of a pontic that is held in place by a metal framework that is bonded to the back of the adjacent natural teeth, rather than being anchored by dental crowns.
4. Implant-supported bridges: These bridges are anchored in place by dental implants, rather than by natural teeth. They are often used when there are several missing teeth in a row.

The process of getting a dental bridge typically involves two or more visits to our office. During the first visit, we will prepare the adjacent natural teeth for the crowns and take impressions of your teeth. These impressions will be used to create a custom-made bridge that fits perfectly in your mouth. In the meantime, we will provide you with a temporary bridge to wear.

Once your permanent bridge is ready, you will return to our office for a second visit. We will remove the temporary bridge and check the fit of the permanent bridge. If necessary, we will make any final adjustments to ensure a comfortable and secure fit. Finally, we will cement the bridge in place and provide you with instructions for caring for your new restoration.

With proper care and maintenance, a dental bridge can last for many years, providing you with a functional and attractive solution for missing teeth.
