# Oral Exams in Salt Lake City, UT

At our dental practice in Salt Lake City, UT, we believe that prevention is the key to maintaining good oral health. That's why we recommend that all of our patients visit us regularly for comprehensive oral exams.

During an oral exam, one of our experienced dentists will:

1. Visually inspect your teeth, gums, and other oral tissues for signs of decay, infection, or other problems
2. Take x-rays to check for issues that may not be visible to the naked eye, such as cavities between the teeth or problems with the jawbone
3. Screen for oral cancer by examining your lips, tongue, throat, and other tissues for unusual growths or changes in texture or color
4. Assess your bite and jaw alignment to check for issues such as TMJ disorder or teeth grinding
5. Discuss any concerns you may have about your oral health and provide personalized recommendations for treatment or preventive care

We recommend that most patients visit us for an oral exam every six months, in conjunction with a professional cleaning. However, some patients may need more frequent exams if they have certain risk factors, such as a history of gum disease or a family history of oral cancer.

In addition to detecting and treating oral health problems early, regular exams also give us an opportunity to get to know you and your unique dental needs. We believe that building strong, long-lasting relationships with our patients is essential to providing the best possible care.

If you're due for an oral exam, don't wait - contact our office today to schedule an appointment. We look forward to helping you achieve and maintain optimal oral health!
