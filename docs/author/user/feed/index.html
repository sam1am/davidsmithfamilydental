<p>Malayna graduated from Dental Hygiene School at Idaho State University and began working for Dr. Bruce L. Lambson, DDS. as a young newlywed. After taking time off to raise a family, Malayna, re-entered the work place and attained her anesthetic certification. Her every Tuesday and Wednesday presence has been a steadying, constant force seeing our office through many changes in staff; in particular, as Dr. Lambson retired turning the practice over to Dr. David O. Smith, DMD. Malayna, has truly been an integral part of our office and her presence will be missed!</p>
<p><span id="more-247"></span></p>
<p>Malayna&#8217;s passion for helping people and keen eye is demonstrated in the following anecdote. Years ago upon arriving at her daughter&#8217;s school class, Malayna, learned that earlier in the day a child had had a tooth knocked out on the school playground. Despite their best efforts, the teacher and other students had not been able to locate the missing tooth. Within, five minutes of arriving on the scene and entering the hunt Malayna, had found the tooth. Believe it or not the tooth was saved!</p>
<p>Malayna, was known for her ability to calm even the most nervous of patients leaving them at ease. She accomplished this through her gentle touch and genuine interest in the personal lives of each patient. It was not uncommon for patients to specifically schedule with her so they could have their &#8220;every six month catch-up session.&#8221; Malayna, will miss all of her lifelong dental friends.</p>
<p>Her skills also extended into the realm of chief &#8220;fix-it man&#8221; around the office. There was many a time she unclogged a drain or restored suction to the vacuum system in a dire circumstance.</p>
<p>Malayna, is starting her retirement off right by heading straight to Hawaii. Afterward, she is eagerly looking forward to spending more time with her grandchildren.</p>
<p>Thank you for your many years of dedicated service. We will certainly miss you!</p>
